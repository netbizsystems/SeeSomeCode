<p>The SeeSomeCode repository on GitHub was created by me to help folks that are interviewing me for a contract/consulting gig get a better idea where to start with regards a coding test.  I’ll be honest, I don’t program in Notepad so if that’s a requirement I’m out!  Visual Studio (I’ve worked with EVERY version) or even the new Visual Studio Code editor is where I live.  And I usually do some analysis, thinking and design BEFORE I write code so don’t be surprised if I can’t write a solution in one sitting.</p>

<p>To me, the “why” behind the code is far more important than the lines written. Both why you choose a particular issue to look at and how you approached it drive a successful project. Yes I can code all the things that you will ask (interface, inheritance, generics, lambda, partial, blah, blah) and no I don’t know all that off the top of my head. I start with an idea and work my way down and might even have to consult StackOverflow on some of the syntax and details. But most importantly, I know what I’m looking for. I’ve found that I can Google what most folks know.. and you can too. But try Googling good, sensible, useful, out-of-the-box ideas and see what that gets you. When you can’t find what you are looking for there.. give me a call!</p>

<p>SeeSomeCode actually does something of interest (to me).. It shows how one could deal with data validation and integrity across the entire application.  My solution makes it real easy to implement data validations in a consistent, maintainable and well documented fashion.  It is NOT written in a way that makes good design sense; it is written in a way to show the use of lots of different programming constructs and to make it easy to read on the screen.  I normally don’t advocate more than one class in a file but I did that here to make you, the readers life easy. Open the code in Visual Studio 2015 and give it a go.. or browse the source in GitHub.</p>

<p>This repository deals with C# and related stuff. I also spend a lot of time with client-side (AngularJS) development and back-end (SQL Server) development. I’ll put something up on those topics soon.  Once again, I think I have some ideas that you haven’t thought of </p>

<p>Talk is cheap.. LOOK AT THE CODE</p>
