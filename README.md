# SeeSomeCode
Thanks for looking at my code.. I think this code and the ideas behind this code might be of help when trying to vet me. To me, the “why” behind the code is far more important than the lines written.  Both why you choose a particular issue to look at and how you approached it drive a successful project. Yes I can code all the things that you will ask (interface, inheritance, generics, lambda, partial, etc., etc.) and no I don’t know all that off the top of my head.  I start with an idea and work my way down and might even have to consult StackOverflow on some of the syntax and details. But most importantly, I know what I’m looking for. I’ve found that I can Google what most folks know.. and you can too.  But try Googling good, sensible, useful, out-of-the-box ideas and see what that gets you. When you can’t find what you are looking for there.. give me a call!

Talk is cheap.. look at the code.
