{"name":"SeeSomecode","tagline":"Since I know you will ask to see some... here is some!  I'd love to discuss it with you.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThe SeeSomeCode repository on GitHub was created by me to help folks that are interviewing me for a contract/consulting gig get a better idea where to start.  I’ll be honest, I don’t program in Notepad so if that’s a requirement I’m out!  Visual Studio (I’ve worked with EVERY version) or even the new Visual Studio Code editor is where I live.  And I usually do some analysis, thinking and design BEFORE I write code so don’t be surprised if I can’t write a solution in one sitting.\r\n\r\nTo me, the “why” behind the code is far more important than the simple lines. Both why you choose a particular issue to look at and how you approached it drive a successful project. Yes I can code all the things that you will ask (interface, inheritance, generics, lambda, partial, blah, blah) and no I don’t know all that off the top of my head. I start with an idea and work my way down and might even have to consult StackOverflow on some of the syntax and details. But most importantly, I know what I’m looking for. I’ve found that I can Google what most folks know.. and you can too. But try Googling good, sensible, useful, out-of-the-box ideas and see what that gets you. When you can’t find what you are looking for there.. give me a call!\r\nI’ve met countless developers that can talk the talk but I keep coming back to…. Talk is cheap.. look at the code.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
